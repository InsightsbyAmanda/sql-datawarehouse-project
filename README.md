# SQL Data Warehouse Project
Welcome to the **SQL Data Warehouse Project**, a hands-on, end-to-end data engineering and analytics project built using **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**.

This project is a structured, practical learning experience inspired by the *DataWithBaraa* course. It demonstrates the end-to-end process of designing a modern data warehouse, building ETL pipelines, and delivering business-ready analytics using the **Medallion Architecture** (Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers).

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The data architecture follows a layered Medallion design:

- 🔸 **Bronze Layer:** Raw data is ingested from CSV files into SQL Server tables with no transformation.  
- ⚪ **Silver Layer:** Data cleansing, validation, and transformation take place here to prepare it for analytics.  
- 🔶 **Gold Layer:** Clean, business-ready data is modeled into a **Star Schema** and exposed for reporting and insights.
